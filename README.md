# Frontend Mentor – Four Card Feature Section Solution

This repository contains my solution to the **Four Card Feature Section** challenge from Frontend Mentor.  
The goal of this project is to implement a clean, responsive layout that closely follows the provided design while using modern frontend tooling and best practices.

Frontend Mentor challenges help developers improve their skills by working on realistic UI problems and focusing on layout, responsiveness, and code quality.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device’s screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- Read content clearly with a consistent and well-structured typographic hierarchy

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - For styles
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.script=Latn&preview.lang=en_Latn) - (Poppins – weights 200, 400, 600)

### What I Learned

Through this challenge, I reinforced several core frontend concepts:

- Translating a static design into a responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Managing typography consistently by defining font rules at the base layer instead of repeating styles in components
- Using Tailwind CSS v4 theme tokens and utilities to keep styles scalable and maintainable
- Structuring a small React project without over-engineering simple UI components

This project also helped me focus on writing clean, readable markup while keeping styling decisions intentional and minimal.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to continue improving in these areas:

- Creating more consistent design systems for typography and spacing
- Improving accessibility through better semantic structure and contrast handling
- Exploring more advanced layout patterns while keeping the codebase simple and maintainable

### Useful Resources

- [Frontend Mentor Submitting Solution](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) – challenge design and requirements
- [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) – utility usage and theming concepts
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) – HTML semantics and layout references

### AI Collaboration

AI tools were used as a learning and productivity aid during this project.

- Assisted with understanding Tailwind CSS v4 configuration and best practices
- Helped refine layout and typography decisions
- Provided guidance for optimization and code clarity

All implementation decisions and final code were written and reviewed manually.
